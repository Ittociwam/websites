                    <p> We as a society are wayyy too sedentary.  AKA we sit FAR too much!  Let’s be honest, a lot of us go to school or work at our 9&dash;5 jobs and sit for HOURS on end, only to come home exhausted, make ourselves some dinner, plop down on the couch, and then head to bed.  I won’t say this is everyone’s lifestyle, but the average person spends 50&percnt;&dash;70&percnt; of their time sitting.  We have these AMAZING bodies, and they weren’t made to sit around.  We need to USE them!  I know when most of us think of “exercise” we think of going to the gym, running on a treadmill, or even often associate it with discomfort and annoyance.  And while I am definitely one to advocate for a gym membership (see “<a href="importance-of-lifting.php"> Why You Should Lift </a>”), exercise isn’t as much about the gym as much as it is about changing your lifestyle!  You can move anywhere and everywhere, and you should!  Exercise can be walking the extra distance through the parking lot or taking the stairs.  It can be squeezing your abs every time you stop at a stoplight or doing 10 sit ups first thing in the morning.  Exercise is something that we should implement into our LIFE, instead of keeping at the gym.  There are SO many modes of exercise available to us, that we should find something that makes us happy and keep at it!  A proper exercise routine should include cardiorespiratory fitness as well as resistance training, or weight lifting.  While these things may sound daunting, you don’t have to be a gym rat to be healthy.  Proper exercise in your life will improve your physique, give you more energy, and increase your self-esteem!  And you definitely don’t need a gym membership to start&dash; So get moving!!</p> </div>
