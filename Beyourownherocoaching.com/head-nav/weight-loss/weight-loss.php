                <p> The CDC reported in 2007 that over 60&percnt; of women in America are overweight, and around 30% are obese.  If you’re reading this, you may be one of those people.  It’s not a secret that many Americans are overweight, but that doesn’t mean YOU have to be.  Yes, we live in a culture that often advocates for an unhealthy lifestyle, but YOU have the power to decide how much you weigh, how you look, and most importantly how you feel.  Having a body fat percentage that is too high can increase your risk of disease, decrease your self-esteem, and even decrease your quality of life.  If you’ve ever tried to lose weight before, you know that it can be very confusing, and there are a lot of different opinions and theories about losing weight.  There’s  also a lot of LIES and DECEPTION that are being fed to you as the consumer, things like fad diets, “secret tricks” and other marketing ploys.  I would like to take a minute and apologize to you on behalf of the media.  Not gonna lie&dash; the media SUCKS sometimes.  It wants your money more than it wants you to actually lose weight, and its messages are often more sabotaging than helpful.  And I’m here to tell not tell you what you WANT to hear, but the TRUTH.  There is no “secret easy key” to weight loss.  You cannot swallow a secret pill or suck down diet shakes for days and magically be stick thin and healthy.  The key to weight loss is not EASY, but it IS simple.  It has to do with a couple of fairly simple equations and simple principles that, consistently followed, will lead to long term succeed.  I won’t tell you that it will be easy, but I CAN tell you that it will be more than worth it!  I want to give you the tools to take control of your life and your body, and be the hero you’ve always wanted.</p>
