                    <dt> <b> 1. Get Enough Sleep</b> </dt>

                    <dd>Getting adequate rest is imperative to your weight loss success.  Waking up exhausted and groggy immediately puts a damper on your day and can often lead to failure before your day has even begun.  Being tired makes it extremely difficult (sometimes it feels impossible) to want to work out and usually causes you to want to snack more often in order to have the energy you need to get through your day.  Lack of sleep also messes with your hormones that keep you on the right track for weight loss.  Not getting enough sleep lowers Leptin levels, the hormone that keeps you satisfied after eating, and raises Ghrelin, the hormone which stimulates appetite.  Finally, lack of sleep can also make you feel tired, grumpy, and depressed, making your goals seem impossible and your motivation plummet to the basement.</dd>



                    <dt> <b> 2. Eat Breakfast</b> </dt>

                    <dd> In the National Weight Control Registry&comma; 78&percnt; of people who successful have lost weight and are keeping it off, eat breakfast every day, and 90&percnt; eat breakfast 5 out of the 7 days a week.  Eating breakfast jump starts your metabolism first thing in the morning and increases fat metabolizing enzymes.  Eating a healthy  breakfast also keeps you from starving later on in the day, which often leads to impulse eating and unhealthy food choices.</dd>

                    <dt> <b> 3. Get Moving </b> </dt>

                    <dd> Exercise is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle and will be a driving force in your weight loss success.  The ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) advocates for 60&dash;90 minutes of moderate to intense activity most days of the week for someone trying to lose weight.  Going to the gym and getting your workout in is definitely a key factor in weight loss&comma; but exercise doesn’t end there!  You can get moving whenever and wherever and every little bit counts&excl;  Instead of driving around for 10 minutes trying to find a good parking spot, park far away and take those extra 5 minutes to walk the longer distance to the grocery store.  Watching T&period;V&period; with your kids&quest;  Challenge them  to a sit up or jumping jack competition during the commercials.  Try taking the stairs instead of the elevator&period;  These little things every day can add up and be big successes&excl; </dd>

                    <dt> <b> 4. Keep a Food Journal </b> </dt>

                    <dd> Keeping track of your eating habits is the only surefire way to make yourself aware of what you eat&comma; when you eat, and how much you eat&period;  90&percnt; of Americans think they eat a healthy diet, when in reality only 5&percnt; do!  Keeping a food journal will help you watch your eating behaviors&comma; so you will know where to make changes&period; I recommend using <a href='/head-nav/nutrition/calorietracker.php'> My Calorie Tracker </a>.</dd>


                    <dt> <b> 5. Positive thinking </b> </dt>


                    <dd>Keeping your goals in the forefront of your mind as you work towards them will be your greatest habit as you begin your weight loss journey!  It’s so easy to get caught up in discouragement, doubt, and negative self&dash;talk.  But if you can just hold on to what you really want and how much you want it&comma; motivation will come easily&comma; and cravings&comma; discouragement&comma; and hard times will fall behind&excl;</dd>
