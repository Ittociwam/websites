                <p>I currently offer 1 on 1 “in person” coaching for the Rexburg, Rigby, and Idaho Falls areas.  These will most likely include weekly goal setting and progress meetings, menu plans, fitness concept lessons, and specialized workouts.  They can also include shopping trips, cooking lessons, and other miscellaneous activities.  For my 1 on 1 training, the most important thing to me is that you get what YOU want out of our time together.  I don’t set up predesigned packages because I think 1 on 1 coaching is just that- individual and unique.  Because of this, I like to have people set up their own packages.  If interested, contact me, and we can set up a meeting where we discuss your goals, commitment, schedule, and time and resource availability.  After learning these things, I can offer you what I think would be best for you to meet your goals, and we can set up a weekly package and corresponding price.  I don’t think that training should cost a fortune, so I try to make everything as affordable as possible.  Price varies depending on our time spent together every week. </p>
