                <p>Hey fellow Heroes!

                    <br />

                    My name is Kate Bise, and I am the creator of Be Your Own Hero.  I am a 21 year old college student  from Spokane, Washington currently finishing up my bachelor’s degree in Exercise Physiology.  I’m also a Zumba Instructor, Personal Trainer, and Life Enthusiast!  I believe in big dreams, baby steps, and lots and lots of progress.  I’ve realized that I can become the hero of my life by following through on my goals, doing those things I’ve ALWAYS wanted to do, and becoming who I’ve always wanted to be!  Be Your Own Hero was created, so that I could share that with you and help you every step of the way.  I believe that respecting our bodies and keeping them healthy is at the core of a happy life and helps you learn the self-discipline and confidence to go after all other goals in your life.  Take a look around and find out how you can be your own hero!</p>
