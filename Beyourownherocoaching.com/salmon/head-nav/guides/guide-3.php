                        <p>None of us know too much about Stinky Steve other than he lives in the woods and is “at one with the river”. When Salmon River Adventures first began he was first sighted on what is now known as Devil’s Dive in a makeshift raft of wood and a tin roof. We watched him navigate the class 6 rapids with ease and grace and then plummet over the waterfall of tenaciousness with a magnificent swan dive and disappear into the water below. He emerged from the water unharmed and we invited him to become a rafting guide on our team. Steve agreed but refuses a paycheck and refuses to take passengers on anything other than Devil’s Dive. </p>
