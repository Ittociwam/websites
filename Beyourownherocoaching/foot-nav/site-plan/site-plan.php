                <h1>Site Plan for Be Your Own Hero Coaching</h1>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the site will be to attract positive attention from people who want help achieving health 
                    and fitness goals. The objective is to help these people change to a healthier lifestyle and obtain a 
                    positive train of thought. The site will have courses on video and through podcast that give instruction 
                    and motivation to these people. It will also contain articles and blog posts on diet and exercise. It will 
                    have tools such as a calendar for tracking progress and a way to sign up for one on one individual help in 
                    the local Rexburg area. 
                </p>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Our target audience will consist of mostly females between 16 and 35 years old of all economic statuses. 
                    Most will be attending college but site will also aim towards late high-school students. Most likely our 
                    users will have already held jobs. They are accessing the site out of a desire to become more healthy 
                    and/or lose weight. They want to boost self-confidence and gain a better body image. Our target 
                    audience spends a lot of time on blogs and social networking sites. They will access the site in spare 
                    time, while or just before working out, and possibly when deciding what plan for meals. Laptops and 
                    smart phones are primary web devices. (emphasis on the smartphone or iPod because our users will 
                    most like be accessing the site while exercising). Our users will most likely use the site for 15 to 30 min a 
                    day. Personal training services from the site will be accessible for users living in Rexburg Idaho, however 
                    the rest of the site is for English speakers looking to take steps to a healthier lifestyle. Target audience is 
                    motivated by uplifting influences and success stories that make working out look like a positive and fun 
                    experience. Site will be accessible by all browsers and while it will be aimed towards a younger 
                    generation that is social media oriented, it will also be easy to navigate for older generations.

                <p>Lindsey is very optimistic but has trouble being motivated on her own. She does fairly well in her classes 
                    despite having poor study habits. She spends a lot of her time surfing the web and checking social media 
                    on her phone. She feels uncomfortable about her image and has tried diet and exercise several times 
                    but has never been able to keep it up for over a week.

                    go back to school. Brian spends most of his off on social media averaging 5 posts a day. His lifestyle is 
                    unhealthy to say the least and he wants to change a lot of his eating habits.

                <h2>Scenario Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can I stay positive when I keep feeling discouraged about my own self-esteem?</li>
                    <li>What are 3 things I can do every day that will help me lose weight?
                    </li>
                    <li>How can I get support from a group to help me when people around me are negative?</li>
                    <li>How can I communicate to my negative counterpart that his cynicism is causing him more 
                        problems and me problems?</li>
                    <li>How can I keep going when I fail time after time trying to lose weight?</li>
                    <li>What are some rewards that I can give to myself as I succeed by tiny baby steps?</li>
                    <li>Can you give me examples of people who have had success at losing weight?</li>
                    <li>How do I stay focused when I am losing weight so slowly?</li>
                    <li>I am at a plateau with my weight. How do I break through that?</li>
                    <li>I know I need to be more healthy but people around me are always sabotaging me. Help!</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>Eating is such a social experience. How do I not offend people around me when I don't want 
                        to eat!
                    </li>
                    <li>There are so many internet sites, magazines, and books on how to lose weight and "change 
                        your lifestyle" but how do I know that this site isn't just another one of those sites? How can 
                        I be sure of the information on this website and that it will work for me?</li>
                    <li>When focusing on losing weight, with your method, do you cut calories? Do you cut carbs? 
                        Do you focus on high protein diets? What is your choice method of obtaining my goals for 
                        eating healthy and losing weight?
                    </li>
                    <li>I've heard many times that one of the keys to dieting and a lifestyle change is a change of 
                        mind. Or in other words, training your mind to think positively. How will this site help me do 
                        that? For me, I believe that is a key thing when my goal is losing weight because it's a hard 
                        process and I need to stay positive throughout it so how is this website going to help me do 
                        that constantly?
                    </li>
                    <li>If I want the one on one individual help, how much is it? I do better at achieving my health 
                        goals when I have someone physically there to help me and to motivate me to go to the gym 
                        but I can't afford most of the personal trainers in my area. How much would something like 
                        this cost me?
                    </li>
                    <li>What is your plan, or tips, ideas, etc for helping these people on your website keep the weight off after they lose it?
                    </li>
                    <li>Have your methods been tried before? Are there success stories or what results do 
                        participants typically have?.</li>
                    <li>Is the program sensitive to my lifestyle and cultural needs?</li>
                    <li>Who supervises this website and what type of weight management training, experience, 
                        education, and certifications does this person have?
                    </li>

                </table>
                <h2>Navigation</h2>
                <p>The navigation for my pages will consist of a navigation bar with drop down menus that can either lead 
                    to individual links under that category or to a secondary that describes the function of that category. It 
                    will also consist of a footer that contains links to pages such as site map and contact us. I want the nav 
                    bar at the top of the page to remain stationary in the same spot even when scrolling like on the Netflix 
                    website. I want each menu item on the nav bar to light up or animate when hovered over and I would 
                    like each one to stay lit up when the user is on that specific page. I would also like the logo to always link 
                    back to the first page. The home page will have both the Nav bar at the top and also pictures that 
                    represent each link and a little about each one so that if the user is not familiar with the site he/she can 
                    read over the pictures and text and determine what link to click on. I like the example of this on 
                    ubnt.com there is a rotating picture menu below the nav bar that has links to several different pages so 
                    that the user can get familiar with the site without diving deep into it. 
                </p>

                <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
                <p>Navigation will condense as screen gets smaller. The Options to watch the introductory or go straight to 
                    the coaching page will appear at the bottom as tabs in the cell phone screen, giving even the small 
                    screens the same functionality.</p>
