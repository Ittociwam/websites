                <p class="unit whole"> Despite what is being thrown at us from the media, advertising, and our culture, when it comes right down to it, FOOD is our FUEL.  That’s it.  It’s what gives our bodies the energy to do the things that we need to do every day, as well as the things that we enjoy and that make us happy.  As would be with a car, putting insufficient or inefficient fuel into our tanks will only make us run poorly.  Poor nutrition makes us tired, lethargic, and unhappy and can also lead to increased risk of disease and increased body weight.  A balanced diet includes eating a variety of foods, including all of the major food groups and limiting less healthy foods, as well as eating the right amount of food for our needs&dash; not eating too much or too little.  Doing all these things will give you more energy, help you lose weight, keep you from getting sick, and most of all, just make you feel great.  Eating a balanced diet is really simple and the benefits are more than worth it. </p>
