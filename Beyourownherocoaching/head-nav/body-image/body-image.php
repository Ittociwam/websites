                <h1>Body Image</h1>
                <img title='Body Image' src='/media/image/body-image.jpg' alt='Body Image'>
                <p> Body Image is how we view ourselves and how we feel in our own skin.  Having a positive body image gives you confidence to go and do everything you’ve ever wanted and truly become who you want  (and were meant) to be.  So what do you see when you look in the mirror?  I’m gonna stop you right now and tell you that you’re probably not giving yourself enough credit.  And that’s not entirely your fault.  The media feeds us a never-ending  current of lies telling us that we need to be thinner, beautiful, and better in general.  Magazine covers and ads are smothered in photo after photo of “picture-perfect”, flawless models that are intended to tell us that we NEED their product in order to be beautiful.  What they DON’T tell us is that THOSE WOMEN DON’T REALLY EXIST.  They are not only pampered and dolled up and posed to look the “best” way possible, but after the photo is taken, hours are spent digitally altering their appearance to make them look “perfect”.  What I want YOU to realize is that PERFECT is not a thing.  And BEAUTIFUL is not a specific weight, body structure, hair color, or style.  The concept of beauty already lies in you, and YOU just have to realize it.  Feeling good about yourself is vital in achieving your dreams and becoming your own hero, and I want to help you get there.</p>
