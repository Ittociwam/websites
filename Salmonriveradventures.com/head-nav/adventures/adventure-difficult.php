                        <p>Devilâ€™s Dive was never meant to be a river adventure. By all means it is considered unmanageable by the most professional rafters. 90% of the route is pure <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty' target="blank"> class VI rapids. </a> There are sharp logs and rocks hidden in every rapid. Only one guide has ever been known to take adventurers through this treacherous part of the river: <a href="/salmon/head-nav/guides/guide-3.php"> Stinky Steve </a>. Because of the remoteness of the area and harshness of the environment we have no way of knowing how Steve manages to navigate this part of the river with minimal casualties. We warn any who come to Salmon River Adventures to stay off this part of the river. The only reason it is still advertised is so that any who wish to attempt this deadly voyage will know that Stinky Steve is the only guide who has ever made it through alive. </p>
