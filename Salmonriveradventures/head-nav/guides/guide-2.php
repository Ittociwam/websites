                        <h2>Bio</h2>
                        <p>Wendy is by far our smartest guide. She is a nature enthusiast and has studied biology and environmental science at MIT. Not to mention previously hosting her own T.V. show “River Beast Hunter”. Not only will you have a great time rafting with Wendy but you will learn a lot as well. You will also get to meet Wendy's pet fox named Snug, who never seems to leave her shoulder. Wendy has spunk, wit and a sense of adventure. Riders have returned from voyages with Wendy saying they gained a large appreciation for the river and the life surrounding it. Wendy is by far our most entertaining guide. </p>
